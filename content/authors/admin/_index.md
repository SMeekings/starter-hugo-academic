I’m a postdoctoral researcher trying to figure out how human voices work. I’m currently supported by a [Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship](https://royalsociety.org/news/2021/09/royal-society-announces-dorothy-hodgkin-fellows-2021/), hosted by the University of York.

We change our voices all the time. We talk differently depending on who our conversational partner is. We adjust our voices to be heard over background noise. And we might try to sound more like people we like or admire. 

But equally, there are things we *can't* change about the way we sound. You might speak with the accent of a place you haven't lived in for decades. Or on the flip side, you might be unable to stop yourself picking up the vocal characteristics of the people around you. And you might have a neurological condition that affects the way you speak, like stammering, stroke, or Tourette Syndrome. 

My research tries to understand speech as it is used in everyday life, and how the brain can help or hinder communication.
