I’m a postdoctoral researcher trying to figure out how human voices work. I’m currently supported by a [Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship](https://royalsociety.org/news/2021/09/royal-society-announces-dorothy-hodgkin-fellows-2021/), hosted by the University of York.

The big questions I’m interested in are:

* How do we control our voices?
* How *much* control do we have over our voices?
* How does your voice relate to your sense of identity?
* How is this different in typical speakers and people who have a neurological condition that affects their speech, like stammering, stroke, or Tourettes’ Syndrome?

My research attempts to address these questions by looking at the acoustics of how people change their voices in different situations, and how this is related to brain activation, as well as more subjective things like feelings of agency and affiliation.
